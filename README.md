This is a code collection for the Signiture Work project at DKU. The data used is from Chinese Longitudinal Health Survey (CLHLS).
These codes are used to generate **survival time** and **survival status** of seven waves (1998, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2018) of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) for fitting survival analysis models.
